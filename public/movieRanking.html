  atmosphere, also the choreography is mesmerizing and it keeps giving me chills
  every time I watch it.

<h3>Anihilation</h3>
<p>
  Stunning visuals, troubled characters, and haunting atmosphere. The way it
  explores concepts of self-destruction and transformation is both captivating
  and unsettling.

  Whimsical and visually stunning, this film is a delightful exploration of love
  and how odd humans are.

<h3>saltburn</h3>
<p>
  Great criticism of wealth and privilege, kinda gross at times but in a very
  unnerving way. The performances are top-notch, and the cinematography is
  absolutely stunning.

  Visually delightful and intricate story, you finish the movie feeling as
  melancholic about this place as the characters.
